how do i build an docker image?
	R: with DOCKER COMMIT  and DOCKERFILE, but docker commit is not really used, always go for DOCKERFILE but for didatic purposes we'll how to use the docker commit way too.

	DOCKER COMMIT:
		first of all you must have a modified docker image such as ubuntu image with something installed, like curl, then use the command
		
		docker commit (ID) name-which-u'd-like-to-put --this commad will create an image with the name of the image you put above

	DOCKERFILE:
		this method use a pre-existing archive which have all the configurations already setted so the terminal just do the work
		you can see an example in the Dockerfile it this repository.
		after the file is set you just need to do de commands:
		
		docker image build -t name-you-want-to-give . --the -t argument passes the next argument to be the name of the image and the . is where it'll be builded

		the dockerfile method have multiple types of use in its repertory such as 

		FROM = initializes the build of an image from another image
		RUN = execute an command
		LABEL = adds metadata to an image
		CMD = define a command and/or the padronized parameters
		EXPOSE = define that the container needs to export the port in question
		ARG = define an agument to be used in the construction process
		ENV = defines environment variables
		ADD = copy remote archives or directories and add them to the filessystem of the image
		COPY = copy archives or directories and add them to the filesystem of the image
		ENTRYPOINT = help you in configuring a container that can be executed as .exe
		VOLUME = define the volume 
		WORKDIR = define the directory


	docker image build -t guilhermebernardo/go-app:multi .

	docker image ls --is used to see all the docker images that are available in your pc rn
	
	docker image prune --to remove all the not referenced images of your pc

	docker image rm (ID) --to remove an image from your pc

	docker image inspect (ID) --to see all the details of an image

	docker image history (name) --gives you the history of the image

	IN THE DOCKER REGISTRY SUCH AS DOCKER HUB IF YOU TYPE IN THE TERMINAL:
		docker login --it will start prompt to verify your authentication and publish your image to the docker hub!
		
		docker push --to launch it to the cloud service

		docker tag --to modify the name of a tag in the docker hub
